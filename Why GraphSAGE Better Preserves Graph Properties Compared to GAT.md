# Why GraphSAGE Better Preserves Graph Properties Compared to GAT

Based on the analysis results, GraphSAGE models appear to better preserve graph properties compared to GAT (Graph Attention Network) methods. There are several architectural reasons for this:

## 1. Neighborhood Aggregation Differences

GraphSAGE uses a sample-and-aggregate approach where it uniformly samples a fixed number of neighbors and aggregates their features. This more "democratic" approach to neighborhood sampling helps preserve structural properties because:

It treats all neighbors with equal importance initially

It maintains consistent representation of neighborhood structures

It doesn't overly amplify certain connections

In contrast, GAT uses attention mechanisms that dynamically weight neighbor contributions, which can:

Distort the original structural properties by significantly upweighting some connections

Create more dramatic changes in how information flows through the graph

Sometimes ignore certain neighbors entirely (if attention weights are very low)

## 2. Parameter Complexity and Overfitting

GAT models typically have more parameters due to their attention mechanisms:

More parameters can lead to overfitting on training patterns

This might cause GAT to optimize for classification accuracy while distorting graph properties

GraphSAGE has a simpler architecture that might better balance:

Learning discriminative features for classification

Maintaining the underlying graph structure

## 3. Structural Stability

The results suggest GraphSAGE maintains better consistency between:

Properties of the training subgraphs (known nodes)

Properties of the predicted subgraphs (unknown nodes)

This is likely because GraphSAGE's aggregation methods are more stability-preserving when generalizing to unknown parts of the graph.

## 4. Application to Financial Graphs

For financial transaction networks like Bitcoin graphs, preserving structural properties is crucial because:

The topological patterns of illicit vs. licit communities contain important signal

Community structures often define behavioral patterns in financial networks

GraphSAGE appears to better maintain these distinguishing structural characteristics

These differences explain why GraphSAGE models consistently scored better on the graph property preservation metrics in your comprehensive analysis.
